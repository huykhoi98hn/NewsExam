# NewsExam

## Coding Test

Create the News’s application that contain 2 pages.
First, show a list of news through this services (https://newsapi.org) to handle the list and pagination
Second, show a news detail that based on selected one.

Required:
1. VIPER or MVVM is preferred
Plus (optional):
1. Modularization Architecture
2. RxSwift, Combine, or Async-Await for iOS. RxJava or Coroutine for Android 3. Unit test
4. Animation and transition in the app

Note:
1. You can create any design you want or try to make it look like below. 2. You can use any libraries that you want also.
3. You can add anything that you think this app must have also.

### Project struct

- Main App: Containt default files and AppCoordinator to navigate root view controller
- Module Common: Define base structure in MVVM Architecture, Style applied in UI, common UI, functions for reuse purpose
- Module Network: Define network manager and network request for request restful API 
- Module Home: Define screens of Home function

### Design pattern
- [ ] Modularization Architecture
- [ ] MVVM
- [ ] Coordinator

### Libraries
- [Kingfisher] (https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher): To cache and prefetch image
- [Snapkit] (https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit): To layout progammatically
- [RxSwift] (https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift): To binding data in MVVM Architecture
- [SkeletonView] (https://github.com/Juanpe/SkeletonView): To display loading content

## Logic Test

1. Please write a function to find the index that has the sum of left’s elements equal to the sum of right’s elements .
Example 1: input => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] output => “middle index is 3”
Example 2: input => [3, 6, 8, 1, 5, 10, 1, 7] output => “middle index is 4”
Example 3: input => [3, 5, 6] output => “index not found”

2. Please write a function to detect that incoming string is palindrome or not
Example 1: input => “aka”, output => “aka is a palindrome”
Example 2: input => “Level”, output => “Level is a palindrome”
Example 3: input => “Hello”, output => “Hello isn’t a palindrome”
Note: Please use only the basic programming function like if-else, loop, etc.
